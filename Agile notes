Story Points
------------------
Probably the most commonly used estimating unit among agile estimating teams globally today.
  Name is derived from agile teams commonly expressing requirements as "user stories".
Based on a combinationn of size and complexity of the work
Unitless but numerically relevant estimates
  A 10-point user story is expected to take twice as long as a 5-point user story


Three Key Advantages
Estimating in story points
  Forces the use of relative estimating
    Studies have shown that we are better at this *(comparison estimating)

Planning Poker for Estimating
* An iterative approach to estimating, loosely based on wideband Delphi (Rand Corp)
* Steps
  * Each estimator is given a deck of cards, each card has a valid estimate
  * Pick a "Keystone" and assign a number
  * Customer/Product owner then reads a story and it is discussed briefly
  * Each estimator selects a card that is his or her estimate in relation to the keystone
  * Cards are turned over so all can see them
  * Discuss differences
  * Re-estimate until estimates converge
